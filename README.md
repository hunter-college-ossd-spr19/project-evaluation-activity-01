## A Project Evaluation  Exercise

### Instructions

This activity is intended can be done as a team effort in class or as an 
assignment to be done outside of class. 
The repository contains a file named `evaluation_template.md` and a list of 
projects in a file named `sample_projects.md`.
The `evaluation_template.md` file is a questionnaire to be answered for each project that
you evaluate. Thus, you need to replicate the questionnaire for each project, making a copy of it
before you start. To be clear, if you evaluate a project named `Go` for example, 
you would copy the template into a file named `Go_evaluation.md`.

This repository should be cloned to your local machine to start.
If it is a team project, each team member will clone the repository.
It is a good git exercise to work on the document simultaneously but on different questions
and then ahve to resolve the inevitable merge conflicts that will ensue.
