## A Project Evaluation  Exercise

### Instructions

This activity  can be done as a team effort in class or as an 
assignment to be done outside of class. 
The repository contains a file named `evaluation_template.md` and a list of 
projects in a file named `sample_projects.md`.
The `evaluation_template.md` file is a questionnaire to be answered for each project that
you evaluate. Therefore, you need to replicate the questionnaire for each project, making a copy of it
before you start. As an exampel if you evaluate a project named `Go` and a project 
named `sketchy`, 
you would copy the template into two files named `Go_evaluation.md` and `sketchy_evaluation.md`
respectively.

If you are given this as an assignment to be done outside of class, 
then the first step is to clone this repository to your local machine.

If it is set up as a team project to be done in class, then each team member would 
first fork this repository to their personal account and clone that fork. In this
case the original repository would be public so that the forks are public. 
As a team activity, it is a good git exercise to work on the document simultaneously but on different questions
and then have to resolve the inevitable merge conflicts that will ensue.
